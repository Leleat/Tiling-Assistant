## Installation

You can install it via https://extensions.gnome.org. Alternatively (or if you want an up-to-date version), download / clone the repository and run the `scripts/build.sh` script with the `-i` flag (make sure to install `gettext` first). It's also on the AUR (but that one isn't maintained me).

## Translations

Translations (even just partial ones) are very welcome!
If you are already familiar with how it works, feel free to directly open a pull request with a `YOUR_LANG.po` file at `translations/`.
Don't worry, in case you don't know how to create a `.po` file. Just open an issue and I'll set everything up. You'll only need a text editor and your language skills :)
