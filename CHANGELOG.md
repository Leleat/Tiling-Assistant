# Changelog

## [39] - 2022-11-23

### Added

- Added active window hint. By default the `Minimal` option will be chosen (#210)

## [32] - 2022-01-22

### Added

- Added new keyboard shortcuts:
    - Restore window size (#134)
    - Toggle Vertical Maximization
    - Toggle Horizontal Maximization
    - Move Window to Center (#132)
    - Toggle `Always on Top`
- Added ability to move tile groups to a new workspace/monitor using the Tile Editing Mode:
    - `Shift`+`Directions` moves the tile group to a new monitor
    - `Shift`+`Alt`+`Directions` moves the tile group to a new workspace
- Tiled windows will untile themselves if they change workspaces
- Allow one action to have multiple keyboard shortcuts (press `Enter` or `Space` when listening for a new keyboard shortcut to append shortcuts to existing ones)
- Added GNOME's native tiling behavior (`Super`+`Up`/`Down`/`Left`/`Right`) to the default shortcuts

### Changed

- Adapt edge-tiling only if it doesn't cover existing tiles. Use `Ctrl`-drag (mouse) or the `Tile Editing Mode` (keyboard) to 'replace/cover' existing tiles. That way 1 window can be part of multiple tile groups
- Reworked tile group detection when a window is tiled
- Renamed `Split Tiles` mode to `Adaptive Tiling`. This is the mode when moving a window around while holding `Ctrl`
- Disabled grouping tiled windows in the app switcher by default and mark that setting as experimental
- Introduce concept of deprecated settings and deprecate the `Toggle Tiling Popup` and `Auto-Tile` keyboard shortcuts
    - Deprecated settings won't be visible in the prefs window anymore unless they have a non-default value set

### Fixed

- Fixed a compatibility issue introduced in v31 with other alt-Tab extensions (#126)
- Fixed the Tiling Popup ignoring the Tile Group setting `App Switcher and Tiling Popup`
- Shortcuts may no longer change unintentionally after using the clear-shortcut-button

## [28] - 2021-12-09

### Added

- Added a Panel Indicator for the layouts (disabled by default). With it you can activate a layout with your pointer or change your `Favorite Layout` (per monitor)
- Added a setting to group tileGroups in the AppSwitcher (altTab) and Tiling Popup
- When dnd-ing a window, hold `Super` to make the tile preview span multiple rectangles. This only works in the `Favorite Layout` or `Split Tiles` preview modes
- Added a `hidden` setting to not adapt the Edge-Tiling to the favorite layouts

### Removed

- Removed the `Change favorite layouts` keyboard shortcut (Use the Panel Indicator instead)

- Visual tweaks to the preference window

### Fixed

- When dragging a window to a new monitor there is a short `Grace Period` (150 ms), in which, if the grab is released, the window will tile to the old monitor. Fix: The `Tiling Popup` will appear on the correct monitor now.
- Fixed artifacts due to the rounded corners of the `Changelog Dialog` (only works on Wayland)
- Fixed animations being skipped, if an animation was already running (#58)

    - It also adapts the keyboard shortcuts and edge previews to the favorite layout
- Changelog dialog to prefs window on new extension version (deactivatable in `Hidden Settings`)

### Removed

### Changed
